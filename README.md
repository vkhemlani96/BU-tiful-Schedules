BU-tiful Schedules is the future of Boston Universityâ€™s class registration process. The application is designed to allow users to find their perfect schedule based on the courses they are planning to take in the coming semester. It speeds up the process by displaying all possible schedules for a given combination of courses in the form of a graph and then allows users to filter out schedules based on certain criteria. Upon choosing a schedule, the application displays more information about each class including the section number used to register, professor names and class locations.
